      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <p>When first looking at this project, I wanted to make sure I understood all the data that we were being asked to visualize. I started by familiarizing myself with how the data was laid out in the given JSON/CSV files for the project. I then started working on the initial sketches of how I would want the layout of my website to be (see image1). Once I had a better understanding of the design layout, I started building my first HTML document for visualization. I refer back to the D3 book many times to ensure that I was correctly coding the basic shells of my visualizations. I wanted to make sure there were visualizations of the difference in age groups and sexes with the data given. I also wanted to showcase a timeline of the deaths and be able to link that visualization with the map of London. Once I had the basics down and got the data displayed, I went into making sure it was correctly encoded with proper coloring to ensure the visualization was easier to understand from anyone's perspective.</p>

      <h2>Rationale Design Choices</h2>
      <p>After building out the visualizations, I chose the colors “sky blue” and “pink” to ensure people could see the difference in sex of the victims being affected by the locations of the pumps. I also went with a simple color palette for the pie charts because I wanted a clear distinction between the pie wedges. With easy-to-read colors, we can allow a better understanding to the user to understand which color represents the victim sex's and age group. Now for how I arranged my charts on the website, I wanted to do an upside-down pyramid design because I wanted them to be able to slowly break down the data as they go through the website. By giving them the map and bar chart first they can understand the severity of the outbreak and how rapidly the map and chart changed over time, and then be able to see more in-depth the critical difference in how the victims ranged in age and sex over the period and the cases that were recorded.</p>
      
      <h2>Visualization leads to new facts and answers to quesions</h2>
      <p>Some question I had while starting this project was, "How much of a difference would there be between the different sexes?". I also wanted to better understand the difference in the age group of the victims. As you can see in (image2), we see that there is only a difference of one person between male and female victims. This was interesting to find out because I thought that there was going to be a different percentage of males and females with males being higher because of the period and how men were the main workers. I was also shocked to see the higher impact on the youngest and oldest groups and how they were the most affected by the cholera epidemic (see image3). I understood that during this period it was not the norm to have the type of medicine we have nowadays and the standardization in sanitation was different back then. One interesting fact that I uncovered while developing my visualization was that the age group between 21 and 40 and 41 to 60 were the least affected by the cholera outbreak. </p>
